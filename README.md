# CPP_Template_Practice
This was just a fun little practice project I did to practice working with template classes in C++. I decided that implementing a common data structure would make for a good practice project, so I created my own implementation of a stack. This implementation uses a linked list to create a dynamically sized stack and of course uses templates to allow it to hold any data type. It is a quick implementation and not the most efficient, but it was a fun little challenge and I learned a lot from it. One of the main issues I had was a boat load of linker errors because the compiler couldn't find the definitions of the template classes as they were in separate files from the declarations in the header files. After doing some research I discovered that the best way around this problem was to use the Inclusion Model and simply define the classes in the header files instead.
